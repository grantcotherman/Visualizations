## Visualization: Tenchiller 2023
Since I was fifteen I have worked part time for a scuba shop in Gore, Oklahoma. At first I filled tanks, and later I drove the dive vessel, helped with classes and worked as a divemaster among other things. Every year on New Year's Day, we host a group dive at our local lake. While I always take photos for divers at this event, I decided to also collect some data this year on the divers and their dives. I collected name, dive time, and the type of exposure protection they were wearing. Later on, I also found out if they had been trained by our shop or not. See the csv in the assets folder for this tabular data (names removed for privacy).
